# Skipper
Skipper Discord Bot

First personal project

All psuedocode files give explanation as to how the corresponding JS code works
	-> Psuedocode is written in the same formatting as the code being explained

## Dependencies
Skipper requires the `discord.js` library and a text file containing language
	-> `npm install -g discord.js` in console to install `discord.js` library

## PLANS
1. Implementing ability to add words to bot language database
2. ~~Implementing moving psuedocode to individual files~~
3. Implementing ability to turn certain words on or off
4. **Implementing ability for bot to add and remove roles from users**
5. Implementing ability for bot to use Spotify/Youtube API to search songs
6. Implementing ability for bot to use Google API to search things
7. **Implementing 'help' command that will DM users with a list of commands for the bot**
8. Implementing 'readme' command that will DM users with the contents of the README file
9. Implementing use of Reddit API (in some why, though unknown how)
10. Possible implementation of NSFW commands (e621, r34, PH, etc)
11. Possible implementation of various website APIs for jokes/facts
12. Possible implementation of APIs to fetch various game stats
13. Once I learn database stuff in my course, implementing creating database files for storing information from many servers in the event that the bot goes down or bot is removed from a server. It will save individual server settings, in case the bot is added back into any servers it is removed from
14. **Convert bot functions to be asynchronous**
